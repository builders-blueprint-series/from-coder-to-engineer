Introduction

## Part 1: A Engineering Mind

### Chapter 1: Coding is easy. Engineering is hard

Engineer is a mentality, not a title
One line a day keeps the refactoring away
Speak up now, or pay later
Titles and years of experience don't matter

### Chapter 2: Favor simplicity over complexity

Easier to understand
Easier to work with
Associate lines with cost
Frameworks aren't friends

### Chapter 3: Poorly written software harms everyone

Bad software hurts customers
Bad software costs money
Bad software hurts developers
Small things add up (broken window theory)

### Chapter 4: The Engineering Process

Tests as a feedback loop
Tests as insurance

## Part 2: Tools of the trade

### Chapter 5: You can't cheat the compiler

"We'll catch it in code review"
Turn lemmings into lemonade

### Chapter 6: Tests don't lie

The purpose of tests

### Chapter 7: Coding building blocks

(Encapsulation)
(Limited inheritance)
(Interface everything)
(Callbacks)
OOP and Functional aren't mutually exclusive
(Functional aspects)

### Chapter 8: Principles to live by

Don't do too much
Interfaces over inheritance
Only provide what is needed
Ideas over implementations

### Chapter 9: Patterns to remember

The purpose of design patterns (make things easier to test)
There are no such things as anti-patterns
Knowing where is more important than how

## Part 3: Common Issues

### Chapter 10: Testing

Not testing
Not testing the right thing
Testing the wrong thing
Overuse of mocks

### Chapter 11: Encapsulation

Public setters
Private methods
Extension methods
Exposed collections
Leaky domain

### Chapter 12: Repetition

Duplication in the presentation layer
Duplication in the data layer
Checks everywhere
Logging everything

### Chapter 13: Coupling

The "new" keyword
Concrete dependencies
Relying on dispose
Injecting the container
Resolving from the container
Over injecting
Fancy injecting
Inappropriate registration

### Chapter 14: Responsibility

Too many conditional statements
Classes doing too much
Logic in the wrong place
