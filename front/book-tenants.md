# Book Tenants

1. Writing and code should be as simple as possible

2. Keep words to code ratio around ~55/45

3. Purpose of examples is to show why not how

4. Every example should follow the format of:

   - Presenting a piece of code

   - Explaining why the code is sub-optimal due to testing issues

   - Present an alternative

   - Show how testing has improved afterwards

5. Every example should come back to the theme of testing as a benchmark, shortening the feedback loop, and enforcing simplicity via common interfaces
