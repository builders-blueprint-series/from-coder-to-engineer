## Coding is easy. Engineering is hard.

Creating software is hard, some of it is our fault as developers. We rush a feature, we don't test a piece of code as thoroughly as we should, we succumb to the pressure of getting something done as soon as possible. It's natural, and it will happen many times during our career. The good thing is that any developer who spends ample time perfecting their craft can lessen these negative impacts on a code base.

Engineering software is very different than engineering a bridge, building, or lawn chain. The process of creating code is not a physical science. As a software engineer, you can't simply apply math to the process and expect a determined outcome. Software is as much about your feelings as hard facts. In the ocean of basic engineering principles, software is a sea of gray.
