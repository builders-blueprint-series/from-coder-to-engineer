### Titles and years of experience do not matter

One of the best aspects of the software profession is that in the author's opinion, your title and years of experience should mean very little to you. While your boss or human resources director may care. And yes, your salary is typically tied to the number of years you have been performing your job professionally. Do not use that as an excuse. For either yourself, your growth, or your potential.

Five years of experience is not required to be a "subject matter expert" in something. Teach yourself something new, make a presentation during lunch to your company and people will appreciate your contribution.

Ten years of experience is not required to be a "lead" in something. Find a topic you are passionate about and teach others about it. When you make yourself available to other as a source of knowledge, people will come back with questions to ask you.

Fifteen years of experience is not required to be a "architect" on a project. If you see an area that may be improved, present your opinion. The worst that can happen is your boss will say no.

### Speak up now, or pay later

- Don't be timid about calling out bad software
- Precedence doesn't mean correctness
- Poor software proliferates exponentially

### Refactor early and often

Creating software is hard, some of it is our fault as developers. We rush a feature, we don't test a piece of code as thoroughly as we should, we succumb to the pressure of getting something done as soon as possible. It's natural, and it will happen many times during our career. The good thing is that any developer who spends ample time perfecting their craft can lessen these negative impacts on a code base.

Engineering software is very different than engineering a bridge, building, or lawn chain. The process of creating code is not a physical science. As a software engineer, you can't simply apply math to the process and expect a determined outcome. Software is as much about your feelings as hard facts. In the ocean of basic engineering principles, software is a sea of gray.

#### Software is commercial art

- Software is commercial art. It has to perform its function, and look nice in the process
- No one will live in a building that is ugly, or structurally unstable.
- There is such a thing as "feeling it" in software. Remember, commercial ART.

### Titles and years of experience don't matter

- Titles mean nothing
- Years mean nothing
- You're only as good as the last thing you learned
- Don't be cocky, but don't accept something "just because"
- Good engineers are humble and let their work speak for themselves
