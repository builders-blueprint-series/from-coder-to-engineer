## Chapter 1: Coding is easy. Engineering is hard

### Introduction

- Software engineering is not black and white, its a sea a gray
- Software is knowing what not to do
- Bad code comes from either not knowing, or not caring, you can't know everything, but you can eliminate the second

### Quote

:speech_balloon: "Brevity is the soul of wit." - Polonius, Hamlet

- You ain't gonna need it

### Engineer is a mentality, not a title

- Good software comes from wanting to write good software
- No silver bullet library, framework, architecture
- Code is a by-product
- Remove yourself from your code
- Code and coders are cheap, engineers are rare and valuable
- Engineers think long term

### Horror Story

:scream: People love to over-engineer almost everything

### Food for Thought

:apple: The Zen of Python (we like simple)

### Titles and years of experience don't matter

- Titles mean nothing
- Years mean nothing
- You're only as good as the last thing you learned
- Don't be cocky, but don't accept something "just because"
- Good engineers are humble and let their work speak for themselves

### Real-Life Example

- Southwest Airlines
- Simple, one plane, class, point to point, easy fare structure

### Speak up now, or pay later

- Don't be timid about calling out bad software
- Precedence doesn't mean correctness
- Poor software proliferates exponentially

### Lesson Learned

:school: Software is commercial art

- Software is commercial art. It has to perform its function, and look nice in the process
- No one will live in a building that is ugly, or structurally unstable.

### Did you know?

:thinking:

- There is such a thing as "feeling it" in software. Remember, commercial ART.

### Conclusion

- Software is hard. So don't be so hard on yourself
- When in doubt, choose the simple way of doing things
- Think like an engineer, not a coder
