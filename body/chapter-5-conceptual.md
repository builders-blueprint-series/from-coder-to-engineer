## Chapter 5: Patterns to remember

### Introduction

- Patterns make life easier
- Patterns are just an extreme form of polymorphism
- You can't improve sliced bread, so embrace it

### Quote (from a pattern language)

### Lesson Learned

:school: Understanding polymorphism was the key for understanding design patterns. It may take you a couple times.

### Knowing where is more important than how

- Don't memorize patterns, memorize when to use them
- Patterns play nicely with each other (pattern composition)

### Food for Thought

:apple: There are no such things as anti-patterns

- Every pattern has a time and place
- Singleton, Service Locator, ect.

### Finding a common interface

(n-1, IEnumerable, Func vs Action)

### Did you know?

:thinking: Design patterns were inspired from architecture, "A Pattern Language"

### Career Advice

The five minute rule

- Can you explain anything to a junior developer in five minutes
- Complex software doesn't mean complex code

### Did you know?

:thinking: Common Interfaces are all around us (USB, Electrical sockets, driving a car)

### Patterns in detail

Mostly showcase behavior patterns

- Command (Common interface, introduce first, common interface)
- Builder Pattern (Dapper, SQL query, Predicates)
- Chain of Responsibility (Complex processes, service call chain)

### Real Life Example (In-N-Out)

- Mediator (Service SRP)
- Observer (Conditional replacement)
- Strategy (Conditional replacement)

### Lesson Learned

:school: Seeing patterns everywhere, you can overuse them.

### Did you know?

:thinking: Asynchronous, what goes on with async, its a state machine!

### Coding Horror Story

:scream: Writing something that already exists (ORM, lots of stuff exists for pattern, di frameworks, mediatR)

### Conclusion

- Patterns turn everything problems into simple solutions
- Trusted, tried, and easy
- Patterns are just us exploiting standard oop principles
