## Chapter 3: Development Fundamentals

### Introduction

- Object Oriented Programming is for related methods and data
- Functional is pure methods
- Can work together really well

### Objection Oriented

#### Encapsulation

#### Quote

- Hide things that are irrelevant
- Hide things that shouldn't bee seen
- Reduce possibilities through the compiler

#### Career Advice

Bad software costs money

- Bad code requires more developers
- Bad code requires more time
- Bad code increases turnover

#### Inheritance

#### Quote (all the good, and all the bad)

- DRY
- Move common logic in parent
- Avoid the copy-paste syndrome

#### Abstraction

#### Quote (details are boring)

- Abstraction is a subset of encapsulation
- Abstraction is encapsulation, encapsulation is not abstraction
- The world is build around abstractions

#### Food for Thought

:apple: Better to be consistent and not perfect than inconsistency perfect

#### Polymorphism

#### Quote

- Another form of encapsulation
- Allow flexibility
- Allowing mocking and dependency injection
- Enables testing

#### Real Life Example

- Costco

#### Career Advice

Bad software hurts developers

- Bad code is frustrating
- Bad code slows development
- Bad code hurts culture
- Bad software reinforces future bad software (cargo cult)

#### Lesson Learned

:school: It may take two, three, or four iterations until you are finally happy with something. Don't be happy because "it works" (React search page)

### Functional Programming

- Minimize Procedural Code

#### Food for Thought

:apple: Software is not a physical science, it's based in math, but does not apply it

#### Method vs Classes

- Classes are scoped. Methods are global.

#### Harnessing Callbacks

#### Coding Horror Story

:scream: "Have to add more RAM because the server keeps crashing" - Guy at bar

### Conclusion

- OOP is good when you have related methods and classes
- Functional is just for methods
- Use both
