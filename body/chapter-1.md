### Engineer is a mentality, not a title

How do you write good code?

Do a lot of side projects? Have good scores on LeetCode? Answer a bunch of questions on stackoverflow? All of these may help you get better at a certain aspect of development. But writing good code is no different than baking a cake, riding a bicycle, or throwing a baseball.

Writing good code comes from *wanting* to write good code.

It means practice, self-directed learning, exploration, experimentation, and most importantly, having the mentality of an engineer. If you currently are not developing professionally for a living, here is a secret to share with you. Engineers in this professional are hard to find. Very hard to find. Many people consider themselves developers, programmers, or coders because they don't take the next step in their career development.

But you are reading this book, which means you want to take the next step in your journey.

You want to be more than just a coder. Because lets be honest. Coding is easy. Anyone can do it. Look at how many "Get into coding in 20 minutes" courses are available out there. If you have three months and some money, you can take a coding deep dive curriculum and be "job ready" in three months.

### Titles and years of experience do not matter

One of the best aspects of the software profession is that in the author's opinion, your title and years of experience should mean very little to you. While your boss or human resources director may care. And yes, your salary is typically tied to the number of years you have been performing your job professionally. Do not use that as an excuse. For either yourself, your growth, or your potential.

Five years of experience is not required to be a "subject matter expert" in something. Teach yourself something new, make a presentation during lunch to your company and people will appreciate your contribution.

Ten years of experience is not required to be a "lead" in something. Find a topic you are passionate about and teach others about it. When you make yourself available to other as a source of knowledge, people will come back with questions to ask you.

Fifteen years of experience is not required to be a "architect" on a project. If you see an area that may be improved, present your opinion. The worst that can happen is your boss will say no.

### Real-Life Example

#### SouthWest Airlines

In the highly competitive and complicated world of air transportation, SouthWest airlines has made a name for itself by flying against the air current of convention. Their business model is the definition of simplicity in the airline world. SouthWest does not operate hubs, instead they fly mostly point-to-point. This eliminates the need for many travelers to connect. Less connections means passengers do not have to worry about a checked bag not making it to the next plane-or a weather delay causing a missed connection. They only operate one type of plane, the 737. They can save money by only needing to train, perform maintenance, and have pilots qualified for a single aircraft. They only have one type of seating, all coach. SouthWest does not sell food on board, and they do not assign seats. In addition, they provide a simple bundled fare system to their customers. SouthWest customers know exactly what they are getting when they buy a ticket. A simple, straight forward, no-frills experience that gets them to their destination. Great software is like SouthWest airlines. Your end-users should get a consistent experience every time without any undue frustration.

### Speak up now, or pay later

### Refactor early and often

Creating software is hard, some of it is our fault as developers. We rush a feature, we don't test a piece of code as thoroughly as we should, we succumb to the pressure of getting something done as soon as possible. It's natural, and it will happen many times during our career. The good thing is that any developer who spends ample time perfecting their craft can lessen these negative impacts on a code base.

Engineering software is very different than engineering a bridge, building, or lawn chain. The process of creating code is not a physical science. As a software engineer, you can't simply apply math to the process and expect a determined outcome. Software is as much about your feelings as hard facts. In the ocean of basic engineering principles, software is a sea of gray.
