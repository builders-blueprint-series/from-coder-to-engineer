## Chapter 2: Embrace the compiler. Save the code review

### Introduction

- Automation is your friend for menial tasks
- The compiler is a good guy
- Other forms of automation such as test suites, and dev ops are good

### Compiler is the first line of defense

- Shortest feedback loop available
- The compiler will never lie
- Use the complier for enforce style
- Pick a style and stay consistent

### Horror Story

:scream: "We'll catch it in code review"

### Using the compiler

- Style vs Best Practices
- ESLint, EditorConfigs, StyleGuides, Prettier, Warnings As Errors, Roselyn Analyzers
- Encapsulation
- Use the plugins, ReSharper

### Real-Life Engineering Disaster

- Tacoma Narrows Bridge
