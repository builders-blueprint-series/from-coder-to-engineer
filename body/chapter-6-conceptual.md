## Chapter 6: Tests Are Insurance

### Introduction

Tests as insurance

- Is it tested
- Is it tested properly (conditional, Assert(1).Equals(1))
- Is it easy to test
- Seatbelt/helmet analogy for why testing is possible

### Quote (something insurance)

### The purpose of tests

- Tests provide clarity
- Tests provide confidence

### Career Advice

Bad software hurts customers

- Poor software is under performing
- Poor software is harder to interact with
- Customers aren't stupid (people can tell your app is bad)
(story moving from android to apple because i could tell the
ios apps were just red-headed stepchild)

### Coding Horror Story

:scream: "I've had great success without unit testing".

### Tests as a feedback loop

- Tests allow rapid change
- Test coverage is a lie

### Engineering Disaster

737 MAX Story - Use analogy of AOA sensor as backup! Tests are that.

### Good To Know

Your customers will break things very quickly. Be flexible and open to change. Don't make assumptions because you believe something is ideal. (Fidel's POS refresh)

### Did you know?

:thinking: Code coverage is not a good indicator of anything.

### What To Test

- Self explanatory
- Unit tests are not enough
- Every condition means a test

### Testing Best Practices

Testing the wrong thing

- Testing method calls
- Writing the same code in the test that you are testing
- Mocks are a false sense of security

### Lesson Learned

:school: XML Creation requiring Approvals testing

### Our Book Project

- Introduce the application we will be working on
- Slowly improve it over the rest of the chapters

### Conclusion

- Tests are insurance
- Testing is not enough, must be correct
- Must test the right thing, in the right way
