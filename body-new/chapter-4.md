# Polymorphism

## Key Terms

- Dependency Inversion
- Inversion of Control
- Dependency Injection
- Generics
- Constraints

## Goals

After completing this chapter you will be able to...

Able to understand the difference between Dependency Inversion, Inversion of Control, and Dependency Injection.

Can apply Dependency Inversion at the lowest level of code.

Understands the basic principle of Inversion of Control and how it affects code quality.

Knows how to implement Dependency Injection and why it is so crucial for automated testing.

Grasp the power behind generics and why it allows us to cut down on duplicate code.

Capable of using generics with constraints to unleash powerful paradigms in object-oriented programming.

## Introduction

- Polymorphism is one of the core tenants of Object-Oriented Programming
- Polymorphism can be confusing to understand when first trying to grasp the concept
- Polymorphism is the most powerful of the OOP pillars
- Polymorphism allows us to leverage automated testing in areas where it would be impossible

## Wisdom

"Don't call us. We'll call you." - All of Hollywood. Sugarloaf.

The "hollywood principle" is a well known in the entertainment industry as a standard for how aspiring actors and musicians are treated before they make it big. When a band or actor is young, the agencies and movie studios have all the power. Software has the same relationship with dependencies. Engineers declare what they desire, and they are called when required.

## Simple Success - Inter-modal Container

- The inter-modal container was introduced in the mid part of the 20th century
- It revolutionized how we transport goods around the globe
- A container can fit on a ship, truck, or train
- Greatly speeds up the time to load and unload goods at every part of the journey
- Another example of a common interface, a powerful part of software!
