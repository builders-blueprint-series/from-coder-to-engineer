## Introduction

- The previous chapters are concerned with how objects can relate to each other
- Coupling primarily deals with how object are created or used
- Chapter 3 deals with the "new" keyword-the de-facto way off object creation. The use of "new" has correct and incorrect usages
- Static is an alternative to the standard way of scoping to an object
